Week 4 Homework - Pandas, pandas, pandas
For this week I selected the Heroes of Pymoli exercise.
I examined the data and created summary statistics for a number of parameters.
## Gender Statistics
>We calculated the overall demographics of the game followed by their purchasing habits.
>Interestingly we find that while the game is predominantly male, males actually are less profitable.
>Both of the other categories, female and other/non-disclosed, tend to spend more money on average than the average male.
>It would seem that if the company was interested in increasing revenue, that they
>should consider trying to foster a more diverse player population as this might bring in people more likely to spend money.


## Age Statistics
>It appears, as we would expect that this data is normally distributed around the 20-24 age group.
>There also appears to be a slight skew towards lower ages.
>Similarly to above, while the 20-24 group has far more total purchase value (because there are so many of them)
>Other groups, namely <10 and 30-34 actually have a higher purchase average. If more of this group could be enticed to play
>or more items that these groups like to use could be introduced, more revenue could be generated.
>An additional datapoint about the age statistics is that the >40 age group has the lowest number and average
>purchase value.

## Repeat Purchases
>Another significant insight for the developers of Heroes of Pymoli is repeat purchases.
>Typically revenue from a game is driven by a relatively small population who make a large
>number of purchases and then a large number who make a few. This game appears to have only
>the latter. They will need to work on finding ways drive repeat purchasing even if only for
>small value amounts. This will help them ascend to even greater heights of revenue.


I attempted to look through the items to see if there was any relationship between
age group or gender and the type of item purchased. Unfortunately the names, while aweseome, are not very
descriptive about what the item actually is.
Someone who had more data on item type might be able to make an assessment like "The <10 population tends to by more character skins"
or "Women tend to buy more two handed weapons." Knowing what we know above about which categories of people have the
highest average purchase we could develop more of these items to increase revenue.

Another useful datapoint would be the statistics for how much of each age and gender group made purchases.
We calculated here the breakdown of people who did make purchases, but is there a specific group that is more likely to make purchases?
Maybe 84% of purchases are male, but if 65% of all females make purchases and only 15% of males. Then that would significantly
alter how you would market and develop improvements to the game.
